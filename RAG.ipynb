The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. The wheezing is most often when breathing out. While these are the primary symptoms of asthma, some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard. In children, chest pain is often present. Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest. A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen. In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best. Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best. Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.\\n    Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma\\n\\n    Doc: 2\\n    Context: An exacerbation (attack) of asthma is experienced as a worsening of asthma symptoms with breathlessness and cough (often worse at night). In acute severe asthma, breathlessness may be so severe that it is impossible to speak more than a few words (inability to complete sentences). On examination, the respiratory rate may be elevated (more than 25 breaths per minute), and the heart rate may be rapid (110 beats per minute or faster). Reduced oxygen saturation levels (but above 92%) are often encountered. Examination of the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal reduced air entry and/or widespread wheeze. The peak expiratory flow can be measured at the bedside; in acute severe asthma, the flow is less than 50% of a person\\'s normal or predicted flow. Very severe acute asthma (termed \"near-fatal\" as there is an immediate risk to life) is characterized by a peak flow of less than 33% predicted, oxygen saturations below 92% or cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips), absence of audible breath sounds over the chest (\"silent chest\" : wheezing is not heard because there is not enough air movement to generate it), reduced respiratory effort and visible exhaustion or drowsiness. Irregularities in the heartbeat and abnormal lowering of the blood pressure may be observed. Severe asthma attack can cause symptoms such as: Shortness of breath, Inability to speak in full sentences, Feeling breathless even when lying down, Chest feels tight, Bluish tint to the lips, Hunched shoulders, and strained muscles in stomach and neck, Feeling the need to sit or stand up to breathe more easily.\\n    Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_severe_asthma\\n\\n    Doc: 3\\n    Context: Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways. Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents. Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold. Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease. Psychological stress may worsen symptoms – it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants. Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.\\n    Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma\\n\\n    ### OUTPUT ###\\n    Doc: 1\\n    Context: An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack.

Additional options include: \\n* Humidified oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.\\n* Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone. One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.\\n* Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks. In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions. Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults. Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.\\n* Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.\\n* Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.\\n* Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists. Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.\\n* The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this. A 2012 Cochrane review found no significant benefit from the use of ketamine in severe acute asthma in children.\\n* For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option. It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies. While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.\\n* Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab, dupilumab, or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma. However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness. Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.\\n* Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.\\n* It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma\\n\\nDoc: 2\\nContext: Staying with a treatment approach for preventing asthma exacerbations can be challenging, especially if the person is required to take medicine or treatments daily. Reasons for low adherence range from a conscious decision to not follow the suggested medical treatment regime for various reasons including avoiding potential side effects, misinformation, or other beliefs about the medication. Problems accessing the treatment and problems administering the treatment effectively can also result in lower adherence. Various approaches have been undertaken to try and improve adherence to treatments to help people prevent serious asthma exacerbations including digital interventions.\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma\\n\\nDoc: 3\\nContext: Interventions include intravenous (IV) medications (e.g. magnesium sulfate), aerosolized medications to dilate the airways (bronchodilation) (e.g., albuterol or ipratropium bromide/salbutamol), and positive-pressure therapy, including mechanical ventilation.

Additional options include:\\n- Humidified oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.\\n- Corticosteroid by mouth for a recommended duration.\\n- Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment to increase bronchodilation.\\n- Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.\\n- Intravenous salbutamol is used only in extreme cases.\\n- Methylxanthines, such as theophylline, are controversial in acute exacerbations.\\n- Monoclonal antibody injections may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.\\n- Sublingual immunotherapy may improve outcomes in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma.\\n\\nWhen to seek urgent medical attention:\\nSeek urgent medical attention if your child experiences severe symptoms such as:\\n- Inability to speak in full sentences\\n- Bluish tint to the lips\\n- Visible exhaustion or drowsiness\\n- Irregularities in the heartbeat\\n- Reduced respiratory effort\\n- Feeling the need to sit or stand up to breathe more easily\\n\\nReferences:\\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma\\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_severe_asthma'}\n"
